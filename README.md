# Langmapper.nvim - another attempt to make neovim friends with other keyboard layouts

This plugin – a wrapper of standard `vim.keymap.set` and little more:

- **Remaps to your layout all built-in CTRL sequences (almost everything, there are always exceptions)**
- **Allow using your lovely keys at same places in normal mode: e.g., ':', ';' e.t.c.**
- **Checking your current system keyboard layout**

> *⚡Disclaimer: The plugin is under active development. I tested it only on Mac and only with russian keyboard layout. PR are welcome*
